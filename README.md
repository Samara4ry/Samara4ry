<details><summary>A little more about me</summary>
<h3 align="left">Bio</h3>

Hello! My name is Samara, a 20-year-old psychology enthusiast and dedicated psychologist. My goal is to deeply understand the human mind and use that knowledge to make a difference in people's lives.

I graduated with a degree in Psychology and am on the path to enhance my career. In addition to clinical practices and ongoing studies, I discovered GitHub through friends and use the platform as an essential tool for my projects. Here, I organize my research, share collaborations, and explore new techniques and methodologies in the field of psychology. I believe that the intersection of psychology and technology has immense potential for innovation in the field of mental health.
